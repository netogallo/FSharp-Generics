@TechReport {TypeProviders,
abstract     = {<p>A growing trend in both the theory and practice of programming is the
                interaction between programming and rich information spaces. From databases to
                web services to the semantic web to cloud-based data, the need to integrate
                programming with heterogeneous, connected, richly structured, streaming and
                evolving information sources is ever-increasing. Most modern applications
                incorporate one or more external information sources as integral components.
                Providing strongly typed access to these sources is a key consideration for
                strongly-typed programming languages, to insure low impedance mismatch in
                information access. At this scale, information integration strategies based on
                library design and code generation are manual, clumsy, and do not handle the
                internet-scale information sources now encountered in enterprise, web and cloud
                environments. In this report we describe the design and implementation of the
                type provider mechanism in F{\#} 3.0 and its applications to typed programming with
                web ontologies, web-services, systems management information, database mappings,
                data markets, content management systems, economic data and hosted scripting.
                Type soundness becomes relative to the soundness of the type providers and the
                schema change in information sources, but the role of types in information-rich
                programming tasks is massively expanded, especially through tooling that benefits
                from rich types in explorative programming.</p>},
