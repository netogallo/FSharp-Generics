\begin{abstract}
The introduction of Datatype Generic programming (DGP) *revolutionized* functional programming by allowing numerous algorithms to be defined by induction over the structure of types while still providing type safety. Due to the advanced type system requirements for DGP, only a handful of functional languages can define generic functions making it inaccessible to most programmers. Ordinary languages provide reflection and duck typing as a mechanism to specify generic algorithms. These mechanisms are usually error prone and verbose. By combining ideas from DGP and implementing them through reflection, a type-safe interface to DGP has been built for the F\# language. These generic algorithms can be accessed by any language running in the .Net platform.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}
To introduce the F\# language and the .Net platform, the classic Haskell function \verb+LaunchTheMissiles+ will be used as example. This function is given the ammount of missiles to launch, traverses the fleet of vehicles and lanuches at most the specified ammount of missiles and returns the number of missiles launched.
\subsection{The F\# Language}
The F\# programming language is a functional language of the ML family. It focuses on being a productive language by levering on functional programming and at the same time easy to adopt by programmers of other .Net hosted languages. As a result, the lenguage has a much simpler type system than Haskell or Scala. Most of the development effort in the language has focused on features to work with data (like type-providers) and to be compatible with the .Net type system. Unlike Scala, F\# performs no type errasure when compiled to the .Net platform.

To begin with the example, the types required for the algorithm will be defined:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
[<AbstractClass>]
type Missile() = class
    member self.Launch() = 
      printf ``Swoosh!''
      for _ in 0 .. self.Fuel do
        printf ``...''
      self.Detonate()
    abstract Fuel with get() : int
    abstract Detonate : unit $\rightarrow$ unit
  end

type Driver = 
  {name : string; age : int}

type Cannon<'t when 't :> Missile> =
  | Empty
  | Loaded of 't*Cannon<'t>

type Vehicle<'t when 't :> Missile> =
  | Tank of Driver*Canon<'t>
  | Artillery of Driver*Cannon<'t>*Cannon<'t>

type Fleet<'t when 't :> Missile> =
  | Empty
  | Member of Vehicle*Fleet<'t>

type Tomahawk(fuel : int) = class
    inherit Missile()
    override self.Detonate() = printf ``Boooooooooom!''
    override self.Fuel with get() = fuel
  end
\end{lstlisting}

Several different type declarations are used in this example. \verb+Driver+ is a record type. \verb+Vehicle+, \verb+Cannon+ and \verb+Fleet+ are algebraic data types (ADTs) similar to those in other functional languages. \verb+Missile+ and \verb+Tomahawk+ are classes. Records and ADTs behave in many ways like types in functional languages since they can be pattern matched and can't inherit from other types nor types can inherit from them. In .Net slang, they are sealed. Classes behave as the types of an object oriented language. They can inherit from other types (as the case of \verb+Tomahawk+) and contain member functions declared with the \verb+member+ keyword. Member functions always take as an argument the object from which it is invoked which is represented by the \verb+self+ before the dot (note that \verb+self+ is an identifier not a keyword).

Another F\# feature used are generic types and type constraints. Generic types are type arguments that are accepted by other types. In this case \verb+Fleet+, \verb+Cannon+ and \verb+Vehicle+ accept a single type as argument. This argument has the type constraint that it must be a sub-class of the \verb+Missile+ class. The type constraints are declared using the \verb+when+ keyword.

Next, the implementation of the \verb+LaunchTheMissiles+ function is provided:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type Cannon<'t> with
  member self.LaunchTheMissiles(n) = 
    match self.with
    | Empty $\rightarrow$ 0
    | Loaded m,c when n $>$ 0 $\rightarrow$ 
      m.Launch(); 1 + c.LaunchTheMissiles(n-1)
    | Loaded m,_ $\rightarrow$ 0

type Vehicle<'t> with
  member self.LaunchTheMissiles(n) =
    match self.with
    | Tank _,c $\rightarrow$ c.LaunchTheMissiles(n)
    | Artillery _,c1,c2 $\rightarrow$
      let l1 = c1.LaunchTheMissiles(n)
      let l2 = c2.LaunchTheMissiles(n-l1)
      l1 + l2

type Fleet<'t> with
  member self.LaunchTheMissiles(n) =
    match self.with
    | Empty $\rightarrow$ 0
    | Member v,f $\rightarrow$ 
      v.LaunchTheMissiles() + f.LaunchTheMissiles()
\end{lstlisting}
Since the function \verb+LaunchTheMissiles+ is supposed to work with many different types, it is defined as a member function of those types. Member functions can be defined for any type and they can be defined in any part of the code (not only at the type definition). For the case of \verb+Canon+ the function simpy calls the \verb+Launch+ method on every \verb+Missile+ and counts the number of calls it made. For the other types, the function is recursively called for the inner types.

As final remarks it is important to point out some of the limitations of F\#. Firstly, the generic type arguments are constraint to be of kind \verb+*+ (star). This is an important limitation since many DGP libraries (like Regular) rely on that feature.

\subsection{The .Net platform}
The .Net platform is a common runtime environment to allow the execution of a family of languages. It implements a very rich type system which includes support for generics. Many type operations that happen in F\# (such as sub-typing) are handled by the .Net platform. The sub-typing relation will be denoted by $\tau_a :> \tau_b$ which means $\tau_a$ is a sub-type of $\tau_b$ and consequently a value of type $\tau_a$ can be automatically converted to a value of type $\tau_b$.

Like most object oriented langagues, .Net sub-typing mechanism that allows types to be automatically converted to types which are higher in the class hierarchy. The F\# language uses the keyword \verb+inherit+ to denote that a type inherits from another type. A well known restriction of this mechanism is that sub-typing rules cannot automatically be applied to generic type arguments. In other words $\tau_a :> \tau_b\ \not\Rightarrow\ T<\tau_a> \ :> \ T<\tau_b>$.

The .Net platform internally uses an abstract class \verb+Type+ to represent any of the types that are available. This class implements operations such as casting or instantiating the generic type arguments of a type. At runtime, any value can be queried for it's type and the program under execution can use this information and even produce new types while running. This collection of mechanisms to manipulate .Net types at runtime is called reflection.

Since the \verb+Type+ class is not sealed. Languages can extend it with any information they want. This allows F\# to include metadata specific for functional programming. Using this metadata, it is possible to determine at runtime what are the type constructors of an ADT and even pattern match the type on those constructors. It is also possible to invoke the constructor with the appropiate values to produce new values. It should be noted that doing so is not type safe since the compiler cannot check that the operations being preformed are safe and type errors will lead to runtime exceptions. Nevertheless, this mechanism is actively used in libraries such as FsPickler \cite{FsPickler} which is a general purpose .Net serializer.

\section{Type Representations in F\#}
The essence of DGP is to provide an abstraction that is able to treat values of different types and equivalent structure as equivalent while still providing type safety. Type representations are used to achieve that objective. The method used here is similar to the approach from Regular\cite{Regular} but had to be adapted to cope with two of F\#'s limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generics of higher kind are not permitted in F\# (nor .Net)
\item Method calls must be resolved statically
\end{itemize}
All type representations are a sub-class of the \verb+Meta+ abstract class. It's main role is imposing type constraints on generics that are required to be a type-representation. Those constraints serve as an alternative to typeclass constraints that are used in Regular. For instance in Regular one might have:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
instance (GenericClass a,GenericClass b) $\Rightarrow$
  GenericClass (a :*: b) where
    genericFunction x = ...
\end{lstlisting}
which in F\# would translate to a class:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type GenericClass =
  member self.genericFunction<
    'a,'b when 'a :> Meta 
          and 'b :> Meta> 
    (x : Prod<'a,'b>) = ...
\end{lstlisting}
and this indicates that \verb+'a+ and \verb+'b+ must be a type representation. Later one will see that the constraints not need to appear in the signature of \verb+genericFunction+ because they are added to the \verb+Prod+ class itself (which is also shown later).

The first sub-class of \verb+Meta+ is \verb+SumConstr+. This is used to represent the possible type constructors that an algebraic data type has. This type takes three type arguments: \verb+t+,\verb+a+ and \verb+b+. The first one indicates the type that this representation encodes (or \verb+unit+ when it is an intermediate representation). The \verb+'a+ argument corresponds to the type representation of values created by one of the type constructors. The \verb+b+ argument contains the representation of the remaining type constructors or serves the same role as \verb+'a+ to represent values created with the last type constructor. Both \verb+'a+ and \verb+'b+ have the constraint $\mathtt{'a},\mathtt{'b} :> \mathtt{Meta}$. For instance suppose one has a type:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type Elems<'a> = Cons of 'a*Elems<'a> 
                   | Val of 'a 
                   | Nil 
\end{lstlisting}
its representation would look like:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type ElemsRep<'a> = SumConstr<
                     Elem<'a>,
                     _,SumConstr<_,_,_>>
\end{lstlisting}
The second sub-class of \verb+Meta+ is \verb+Prod+. This type is used to represent cases in which a type constructor accepts more than one argument. The \verb+Prod+ type accepts two type arguments: \verb+'a+ and \verb+'b+. The first argument contains the type representation of one of the constructor's parameters. The second argument contains the representation of the remaining constructor's arguments or the type \verb+U+ which is used to denote emptyness. Both \verb+'a+ and \verb+'b+ have the constraint $\mathtt{'a},\mathtt{'b} :> \mathtt{Meta}$. With this constructor it is possible to fill the blanks of \verb+ElemsRep+ as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type ElemsRep<'a> = SumConstr<
  Elem<'a>,
  SumConstr<
    Prod<_,Prod<_,U>>,
    SumConstr<
      Prod<_,U>,
      U>>>
\end{lstlisting}
The third sub-class of \verb+Meta+ is \verb+K+. This type is used to represent a type that is not an ADT. Such types cannot be generically manipulated with DGP, nevertheless it is possible to write algorithms that operate on ocurrences of a particular type(s) inside a ADT. The \verb+K+ constructor takes a single type argument \verb+'a+ which corresponds to the type of its content. Since F\# cannot statically constrain a type to be or not to be an ADT, \verb+'a+ has no constraints. To continue with the example above, the type \verb+Elem<int>+ would be represented as:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type ElemsRep = SumConstr<
  Elem<int>,
  SumConstr<
    Prod<K<int>,Prod<_,U>>,
    SumConstr<
      Prod<K<int>,U>,
      U>>>
\end{lstlisting}
The fourth sub-class of \verb+Meta+ is \verb+Id+. This type is used to represent recursion within a type. This is necessary otherwise a type representation would be infinite for recursive ADTs. This type takes a single type argument which is the which is the same type being represented. With this addition, \verb+Elem<int>+ is now represented as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type ElemsRep = SumConstr<
  Elem<int>,
  SumConstr<
    Prod<K<int>,Prod<Id<Elem<int>>,U>>,
    SumConstr<
      Prod<K<int>,U>,
      U>>>
\end{lstlisting}
The last sub-class of \verb+Meta+ is \verb+U+. This type is used to represent an empty argument in a type constructor. That is the reason the \verb+Nil+ constructor is represented as \verb+U+ and ocurrences of \verb+Prod+ will always have \verb+U+ as the second argument of the innermost \verb+Prod+.
\section{Generic Functions}
The purpose of type representations is to provide an interface that the programmer can use to define generic functions. In other words is a language to define what the semantics of such functions are. The library will then be provided with a generic function definition and will apply it as appropiate to the values it is provided with.

To show how generic definitions look like, the generic function \verb+gmap+ will be defined. This function accepts as an argument a function of type $\tau\to\tau$ and applies the function to every value of type $\tau$ in a ADT. In Regular, a generic function is defined as a typeclass. In this implementation, they are defined as an ordinary .Net class:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type GMap<'t>(f : 't $\rightarrow$ 't) = class end
\end{lstlisting}
The class has a constructor that takes as argument the function that will be applied. The first step is dealing with the sum of type constructors. As explained in the previous section, they are represented by \verb+SumConstr+:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
member x.gmap<'x>(v : SumConstr<'t,Meta,Meta>) =
  match v with
  | L m $\rightarrow$ SumConstr<'x,Meta,Meta>(
             x.gmap m |> Choice1Of2)
  | R m $\rightarrow$ SumConstr<'x,Meta,Meta>(
             x.gmap m |> Choice2Of2)
\end{lstlisting}
Here the active patterns \verb+L+ and \verb+R+ are used to distinguish the two possible cases. Nevertheless, \verb+gmap+ is simply invoked recursively and the result is packed inside the same constructor. The next step is to deal with products. This is handled with the \verb+Prod+ constructor:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
member x.gmap(v : Prod<Meta,Meta>) =
  Prod<Meta,Meta>(
    x.gmap(v.E1),
    x.gmap(v.E2))
\end{lstlisting}
The type \verb+Prod+ contains the properties \verb+E1+ and \verb+E2+ that access each of the elements of the product. Once again, \verb+gmap+ is invoked recursively on those values. Next is the case for the \verb+K+ constructor which contains values. Here is where the function gets applied:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
member x.gmap(v : K<'t>) = K(f v.Elem)
\end{lstlisting}
The property \verb+Elem+ of the \verb+K+ constructor returns the value that is being represented by \verb+K+. Note that this member only works for fundamental values that have a type that matches the argument function. Later it will be explained how other instances of \verb+K+ work.

The case for the \verb+Id+ constructor is a bit more involved because \verb+Id+ contains a property called \verb+Elem+ but the property contains a value, not a representation. In order to obtain the representation, the type \verb+Generic<'t>+ is provided. This type contains the members:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
member x.To : 't $\rightarrow$ Meta
member x.From : Meta $\rightarrow$ 't
\end{lstlisting}
With that class it is now possible to extract the contents of \verb+Id+, call the \verb+gmap+ function and convert the result back to the original type. This results in:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
member x.gmap(v : Id<'t>) =
  let g = Generic<'t>()
  Id<'t>(x.Everywhere(
    g.To c.Elem) |> g.From)
\end{lstlisting}
There are still two pices missing in this generic function. First of all, the recursive calls are invoking \verb+gmap+ with an argument of type \verb+Meta+ and there is no overload that matches that type. Secondly, not all cases are covered. Addressing both of theese problems requires some boilerplate code and validations that cannot be checked by the compiler. To make matters simple, a type provider is used.
\section{The Generic Type Provider}
In the previous section, the existence of a \verb+gmap+ function with type \verb+Meta+$\to$\verb+Meta+ was assumed. Since \verb+Meta+ is an abstract class, the actual role of the function is to select the \verb+gmap+ overload that corresponds to the argument provided. The typeclasses mechanism in Haskell selects the overload by type-level computations that ocurr during the type-checking process. However, F\# lacks such mechanism. To achieve this, reflection is used with the help of a type provider to provide some static safety checks. The generic type provider is used as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[
  mathescape,
  columns=fullflexible,
  basicstyle=\fontfamily{lmvtt}\selectfont,
]
type GMapBase = Generic<''GMap'',1>
\end{lstlisting}
The type provider accepts two static arguments. The first one denotes the name of the generic function and the second one the number of arguments the generic function accepts. This produces a type with a method \verb+GMap+ of type $\mathtt{Meta} \to \mathtt{Meta}$. The method when invoked will use reflection to invoke the appropiate overload using the following selection criteria:


The F\# language does not support generics of higher kind. This means that generic types in F\# cannot be applied to other types. This feature is used by other DGP \cite{Regular,MultiRec,GenericDeriving,RepLib} to enforce type safety and allow the compiler to select
